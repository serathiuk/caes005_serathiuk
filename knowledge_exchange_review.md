## Open Sourcing Miranda

David Turner started talking about the history of Miranda. It is a lazy, polymorphic, purely functional language created by him in the 1980s. It is a lambda calculus-based language.  It was the main Haskell language precursor. Miranda was open-sourced under the BSD License in your 64-bit version. Before that, it was closed-source.

David Turner explained the process of updating Miranda to a modern 64-bit open-source version using C2011 besides the “old” C language (Kernighan & Ritchie, “The C Programming Language”, 1978). Miranda has more than 500 C functions. After seven months of work, Turner finished the new version, which is now compatible with new operational systems.

He believes it will help popularize the language, and he thinks it is a good functional language because it is simpler to understand and learn. Turner had projects to modernize the syntax and make it similar to Haskell. Like the possibility of lower-case identifiers. Turner had other plans to the language, like writing entirely in Miranda.

In my opinion, Miranda is a great language. But, the decision in the past to make it closed-source and the restrictive license prevented adoption of the language. Miranda was the main base of Haskell, and Haskell is the inspiration for many modern programming languages. Miranda has a lot of importance in the history of computer science, but it took too long to decide to open-source Miranda. I learned without a strong community, a functional language, or other technology is difficult to popularize.  A funny part: Turner said he tried to open-source Miranda on Github, but he does not understand Git very well.
